My name is Eduardo Aguilera Olascoaga and I am a Software Engineer with a pasion for great products. The purpose of this blog is to put on "paper" what I learn on a daly basis. If you come cross with something useful, please pass it on. Knowledge deserves to be shared. Otherwise, if you think something I wrote is wrong, inaccurate or not useful, help me and leave a comment with your thoughts.

Edge cases are everywhere, but they hide in plain sight. Because of this, take everything in this blog with a grain of salt. Make it yours and apply it how you think it is best.
